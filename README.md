- Today we need to add mendatory and non-mendatory fields in the webform which are required to fill a complaint.

- Made a rough of them.



### :arrow_right: *DAY 65 (22/09/2022)*

 - Today we add the required fields.
 - Then I made a workflow with CMC doctype in whch I create some states correspondence to respective users.
 - Also I add some transition rules in the workflow in which actions are made for the users in the way, how we turn the flow of request on the basis of that actions like "Approve" action for approve the request and "Reject" action for rejection. 


### :arrow_right: *DAY 67 (23/09/2022)*

 - Now its time to show the states and actions made in workflow to subordinates and whole team.

### :arrow_right: *DAY 68 (25/09/2022)*

Sunday day - Fun day 



### :arrow_right: *DAY 69 (26/09/2022)*

 - Today, I made some changes according to sir told me. Which I showed them and also to my team mates.
 - Now we are facing an issue in the workflow, and the issue is that when an applicant puts his/her request, it showed to all the upper level users without taking any intermediate actions.What we want is that when an applicant put the request, the request will go to Hod and when he perform the forward action,only then the request should go to upper level. 
 - Today, I invested my whole day to resolve the issue but doesn't reach at any conclusion, It disappointed me alot but a little patience is needed here.


 ### :arrow_right: *DAY 70 (27/09/2022)*
 
 - Today I'm back with much potential to resolve the issue and I'm exploring the relatable stuff with the help of internet.
 - Parallely, our another project of Nankana Sahib Public School is also on its way. 
 - Apart from this, I also read mails of my subordinates and another members on GD (Great Developers, an official Group on Email) and also contribute in them.
 

### :arrow_right: *DAY 71 (28/09/2022)*

 - Today we made some more users and some more roles related to Maintenance cell
 - Roles and users are:
   -  SDE (Sub Divisional Engineer)
   -  CMC Head (Head of Construction and Maintenance Cell).
 - Along with this, we also set some permissions of them.

### :arrow_right: *DAY 72 (29/09/2022)*

 - As our level wise flow doesn't work properly, so after a lot of struggle and exploration, what we observed that all the requests are viewed in list view
 - So we can filter them according to their name of states for particular users. Like Hod user can only be able to se the requests which are in pending state and SDE can be able to see only those requests which are in forwarded states
 - So we make complete setup of filters as we needed and this issue has been resolved successfully.


### :arrow_right: *DAY 73 (30/09/2022)*

 - Today, we showed to sir how I resolve the issue by using the filters and then I continue my task. 
 - My next target is to make the workflow conditional, in such a way that the request from a particular department should only shows to the Head of same department.
 - For this, following the rule of self service, I explored how conditional workflow works and what conditions should be applicable for that.


### :arrow_right: *DAY 74 (01/10/2022)*

 - Today seminars off


### :arrow_right: *DAY 75 (02/10/2022)*

Sunday day - Fun day 


### :arrow_right: *DAY 76 (03/10/2022)*

 - To fulfill the requirement, I need to find how we can put the department wise condition in the workflow transition rules. 
 - To apply the condition, first we need to fetch the department of the applicant in the webform automatically so that we can easily put the condition on the basis of fetched department.
 - For this, we add some more users with different department and start making the database query to achieve our target.


### :arrow_right: *DAY 77 (04/10/2022)*

 - For the above task, first we need to add a field naming "Department" in the webform first in which the department be automatically fetched. 
 - This task is quite challenging and we are continuously working on it. 
 - We found that there is a column of department present in the employee table in the database.
 - After a lot of testings we are yet unable to fetch the department and this examined our patience and struggle.


### :arrow_right: *DAY 78 (05/10/2022)*

Happy Dussehra!


### :arrow_right: *DAY 79 (06/10/2022)*

 - We are back and we continued our latest pending task form where we left it. 
 - So after a lot of struggle, finally we make a query with the help of which we are able to fetch the department of employee who puts the request successfully.
 - Below is database query:
   - var = frappe.db.sql("""
    select
        e.department
    from
        tabDepartment as d join tabEmployee as e on e.department = d.name
    where
        e.user_id=%s
    """, frappe.session.user)

function myFunction() {
  // Declare variables
  var input, filter, table, tr, td, i, txtValue;
  input = document.getElementById("myInput");
  filter = input.value.toUpperCase();
  table = document.getElementById("myTable");
  tr = table.getElementsByTagName("tr");

  // Loop through all table rows, and hide those who don't match the search query
  for (i = 0; i < tr.length; i++) {
    td = tr[i].getElementsByTagName("td")[1];
    if (td) {
      txtValue = td.textContent || td.innerText;
      if (txtValue.toUpperCase().indexOf(filter) > -1) {
        tr[i].style.display = "";
      } else {

### *Finds the appropriate solution for upgrading Frappe v13 to Frappe v14*

- Today my task is to find the appropriate solution for upgrading Frappe v13 to Frappe v14.
- In the morning there is a meeting with the mentors of SDC.
- After that I started work on my task.
- I find the following link from where I am getting the reference.
  https://cloud.erpgulf.com/blog/support-forum/erpnext-upgrade-from-version-13-to-version-14-ubnutu

#Steps I follow:-

1- Take backup.

2- Make sure you don't have any customization those are not committed.

3- Check python version

4- Check node version.

5- Check pip or pip3 version ( needs to be upgrade to 22.x )

### :arrow_right: *DAY 91 (13/10/2022)*

- Continue yesterday work.

6- Upgrade python
```
sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt install python3.10 python3.10-dev python3.10-distutils
```
Make Python 3.10 the default.
```
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3
/usr/bin/python3.10 1
```
Make sure python command executes python3
```
sudo apt install python-is-python3
```

7 - Upgrade PIP
```
curl -sS https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python3.10
pip install html5lib
pip3 install --upgrade pip
sudo apt-get remove python3-apt -y
sudo apt-get install python3-apt -y
```

- In the step 8 I am facing an error.

### :arrow_right: *DAY 92 (14/10/2022)*

- At the Step 8 I am getting an error while upgrading the version of node.Which is resolve by the command nvm install node.

Instead of following command :-

8- Upgrade Node
```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | bash -
apt-get install nodejs redis-server -y
```
I am using the following commands:-
```
nvm install node
sudo apt-get install redis-server
```

9- Upgrade NPM
```
npm upgrade
sudo npm install 16
sudo npm install -g npm@8.19.1
```

10 -Move your old python env folder to env-archive, in-case anything
goes wrong, you can return to the original
```
/home/simran/frappe-bench/
mv env env-archive
(Please check your frappe bench path)
```

11- Create new virtual env for python-3.10
```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv --python python3.10 env
env/bin/pip install -U pip
```
I was getting an error while running the second command so I created
the virtual environment by the following command:-
```
bench setup env
```

### :arrow_right: *DAY 93 (15/10/2022)*


12- Change git upstream from V13 to V14
```
env/bin/pip install -e apps/frappe -e apps/erpnext
pip3 install frappe-bench
bench switch-to-branch frappe erpnext version-14
```
(This command take my half an hour and after that gave me an error so
I run the below command instead of this)
```
bench switch-to-branch version-14 frappe erpnext --upgrade
```

13- Migrate your site
```
bench --site {site_name} migrate
This command works only when the bench is start.
```
After completing all the steps I am facing the following problem:-
After completing all the steps I am facing the following problem:-

- Next problem we faced is CMC_Head unable to see the quotation. For this we see all the roles and roles permissions  but we are unable to
  find anything from that. 
- After that we find that there is some user permission for a user CMC Head which restricts the CMC Head to see the quotation list.


### :arrow_right: *DAY 96 (18/10/2022)*

- We add the custom script in Quotation doctype.( Grand Total = total_cost+ labour cost).
- After that we discussed with Rai Sir in the evening meeting that there is no need to customize the quotation doctype. 
- Instead of this I add some services in the item list and delete the customization that I made on quotation doctype.
- Pending work:- When total_cost(in Quotation)>total_cost(in Bill) then it shows an alert message.

### :arrow_right: *DAY 98 (20/10/2022)*

### Work I do Today for completing the first task.
- In the CMC Project we want the linking of Quotation,Sales Order and Sales Invoice with the CMC Request.
- Solution:- We added one field(CMC Request no.) in the all the doctypes(Sales invoice, Sales Order and quotation) and fetched the CMC Request No.           automatically.
- For this we use the connections.
- When total_cost(in Quotation)>total_cost(in Bill) then it shows an alert message.

- Solution:-For this we fetch the total cost of quotation in the Sales
- Invoice doctype and add the following client script in it.
```
frappe.ui.form.on('Sales Invoice', {
    refresh(frm) {
        if (frm.doc.grand_total > frm.doc.quotation_total) {
        frappe.msgprint('Your Total Cost exceeding the Estimate Cost!!!')
}
    }
})
```
